Personal portfolio page.

My first "project" while learning html/css/jQuery. It uses quite a lot of Bootstrap features and as I wanted to have this nice, trendy paralax effect I used 'waypoints.js' library.

Part of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) challange [*Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage *](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)
